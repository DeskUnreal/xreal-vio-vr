# Simple, this is a outline for a potential expansion.
# What for?
# Well, AR does not need chaperones and can't expect ground calibration
# If you want to use it for outdoors activities.
# So this is the result. Put the chaperones in the bin and use magnetometer and GPS!
# Possibly pokemon go AR? We'll see.
