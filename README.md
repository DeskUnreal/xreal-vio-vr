# xreal-vio-vr

🌀 **A lightweight Linux spatial computing stack for the XREAL Ultra**  
✴ *Early-stage project — experimental and evolving daily*

**Built by @deskunreal**

Goal: Power your headset with stereo SLAM, Joy-Con input, Hand Tracking, and a minimalist 3D desktop — no Unity, no Unreal, no bloat.

## ⚠️ Status: Under Heavy Construction

This is a **work-in-progress** project. Expect:

- Bugs 🐛  
- Missing scripts  
- Sudden architecture changes  
- TODOs all over the place

👀 Curious devs welcome — but this is not plug-and-play (yet).  
Got questions? Start a discussion or submit an issue — feedback shapes the stack.

## 💡 Vision

- 📷 SLAM from XREAL Ultra's stereo camera + IMU  
- 🎮 Joy-Con input instead of complex hand tracking  
- 🪟 Floating Linux desktops in VR  
- 🎯 SteamVR-compatible pose injection  
- 🧠 Designed for wearable PCs and eventual full spatial shell
